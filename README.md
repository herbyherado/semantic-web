### Semantic Web

Create a static web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The webpage can follow any theme using your own design or other design from any website that you like. 

HTML markup writing should follow as per W3C standards (https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/)

Minimize all warning occurences and ensure that the webpage is free from errors.
